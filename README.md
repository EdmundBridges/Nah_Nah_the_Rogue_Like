# Nah_Nah_the_Rogue_Like
Nah Nah was a group school project for my Database Systems class.

This project was created in Sublime 3 text editor and run using XAMPP for a group school project. It implements a MySQL database, and uses rudimentary knowledge of php, html, and java script that was self taught, along with the SQL taught by the class. It is a basic click game that implements simplistic game-play to demonstrate database connectivity and manipulation.
