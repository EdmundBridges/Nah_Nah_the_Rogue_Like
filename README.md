# Nah_Nah_the_Rogue_Like
Nah Nah was a group school project for my Database Systems class.

This project was created in Sublime 3 text editor and run using XAMPP for a group school project. It implements a MySQL database, and uses rudimentary knowledge of php, html, and java script that was self taught, along with the SQL taught by the class. It is a basic click game that implements simplistic game-play to demonstrate database connectivity and manipulation.

How to Use:
If you don't have XAMPP or similar softwear you can download it here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Import the Nah Nah Database file into phpmyadmin.
Add the files to the htdocs file in XAMPP.
With XAMPP Running, go to http://localhost/NahNahNew/
